# Arch 1.4 (final update) Source code
This is the ending point for arch, no more updates unless its major (some features might be removed due to complications but no new features will be added to arch) so I thought I might as well open source it, thank you everyone for 18,000 downloads which I never thought would be possible.
The source to arch can be used in any way you like, are you making a tweak and want it to be paid but it uses a part of archs source code and you really dont want to take the time to go remake that part? you can keep on using archs source code with no reprocussions unless by someone who didnt read this and if they didnt redirect them to this readme. you can use it in ANY way you want.
